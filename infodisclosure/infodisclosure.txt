Briefly explain the vulnerability and why the secure version prevents the vulnerability.

Ans - Here a malicious agent can inject mongodb queries or conditions which can return back 
unnecessary information. Secure version prevents it by sanitizing the input so that no one can inject
any conditions.


Which CIA property does information disclosure violate?

Ans - It violates confidentiality as malicious agents can get access to unauthorized information.

What additional security mechanisms can you incorporate?

In this scenario a user information can be leaked by trial and error by putting username. So we can create 
a more secure authentication. Also console.log should be removed. When you send back sensitive objects, 
encrypt and send it.
