- Briefly explain the vulnerability and why the secure version prevents the vulnerability.

We are directly using findOne on id which comes from any user or malicious agent. If an unexpected
id comes, there is an error due to which mongodb does not return anything crashing the server.
The secure version prevents it as we have a try-catch block for error handling so that if an 
unexpected event occurs, it still returns information to the user and not crashing the server.


- What additional security mechanisms can you incorporate to prevent such attacks?

Additionally we can add data sanitization for the input as right now id is directly sent to 
mongodb. To prevent ddos, we can add rate limiting on the middleware.
