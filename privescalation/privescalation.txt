Q Briefly explain the vulnerability and why the secure version prevents the
vulnerability.

A The vulnerability in this case was that there was no authentication in this at all. 
So we need an authentication mechanism to decide if the endpoint needs to be allowed 
to an user. In the secure version, we are checking the sessionID to find if the person
is logged in and also part of the database. This is a form of authentication to decide 
which person has access.

Q What additional security mechanisms can you incorporate to prevent such
attacks?

A Additionally we can add 2FA to authenticate.
